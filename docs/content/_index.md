### [Jenkins Pipeline](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/)

Jenkins 2 brings Pipeline as code, a new setup experience and other UI improvements, let you define delivery pipelines using concise Groovy scripts which deal elegantly with jobs involving persistence and asynchrony. Introduces a domain-specific language (DSL) that helps Jenkins users to model their software delivery pipelines as code, which can be checked in and version-controlled along with the rest of their project's source code.

This repository contains instructions and labs related Jenkins Pipeline Workshop.
